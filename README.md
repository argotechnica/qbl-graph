# qbl-graph
Graph database model of the Tree of Life according to Hermetic Qabalah

This project an attempt to map out the correspondences on the Qabalistic Tree of Life according to the Western Hermetic tradition, particularly as described by Israel Regardie, but hopefully (eventually) incorporating multiple systems with attribution to what the source was.

In particular, Regardie's *A Garden of Pomegranates* is my primary text at the moment for spellings, terms, and correspondences. I'm using Chic & Sandra Tabatha Cicero's 1995 3rd edition of the text; the original was written in 1931.
